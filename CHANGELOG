- Fixed console_width bug found by Ilmari
- Changed Application_wo_Autorun to BasicApplication
- Added support for SYNOPSIS and DESCRIPTION categories in
  the man page to contain multiple paragraphs.
- Added WARNING for possible misspelling of initialize.
- Added #use_posix to application so posix OptionParser can be invoked.
  It is not automatic, even though all options could be posix. Should we change this?
